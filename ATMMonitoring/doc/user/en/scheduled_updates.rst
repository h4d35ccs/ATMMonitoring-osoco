ATMMonitoring allows us to execute scheduled data updates from ATM, that is, the updates execute  periodically at a given time. In this way we ensure that the ATMs data  are kept updated as often as we deem necessary.

.. warning:: To schedule an update it is necessary to have at least one created query, to do so go to the **Terminals** section
