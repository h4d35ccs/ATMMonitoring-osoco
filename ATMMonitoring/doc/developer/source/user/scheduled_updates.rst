Scheduled Updates

ATMMonitoring allows us to execute scheduled data updates from ATM, that is, the updates execute  periodically at a given time. In this way we ensure that the ATMs data  are kept updated as often as we deem necessary.

We can access scheduled update page through the link *Scheduler* the side menu.
